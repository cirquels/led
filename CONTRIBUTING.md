# Contributing to Cirquels LED Gear

If you want to submit your own changes to Cirquels LED Gear, that's awesome! Here's how:

1. For the repository, clone it to your local machine, make a branch.
* Make your changes.
* Test they work.
* Push the changes to your repository.
* Open a pull request.

We'll review your pull request, and if we like the changes we'll merge them in to `master`.

## What needs doing?

Whatever you want. Cirquels will maintain the repository for our own needs, but feel free to tweak it.

We always like efficiency improvements in the code.

## Useful Things to Know

Your branch will need to compile as part of the automated testing before we'll accept it. This means your code will need to compile to an Arduino Nano 3.0 for the SmartStaff code, and an Arduino Uno for the Base code.
