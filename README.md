# Cirquels LED Gear

Cirquels LED Gear is designed to mount to the end of staffs, and provide super-cool colour sequences. It can also be used with a base station, which can remotely control and synchronise staffs.

## Components

### SmartStaff

The SmartStaff units mount to the end of staffs, and light up in cool colours. They are powered by a 9V battery, and use an Arduino Nano to control the light sequences.

## Base

The base unit can provide remote control of the SmartStaff units via 433.92MHz radio. It is powered using either a 12V battery pack, or a 12V mains supply.

## Prerequisites

* You'll need [RadioHead](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/) in your Arduino libraries.

## Hardware

Plans for how to build your own hardware are coming soon.
