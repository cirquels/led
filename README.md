## Components

### SmartStaff

The SmartStaff units mount to the end of staffs, and light up in cool colours. They are powered by a 9V battery, and use an Arduino Nano to control the light sequences.

### Base

The base unit can provide remote control of the SmartStaff units via 433.92MHz radio. It is powered using either a 12V battery pack, or a 12V mains supply.
